Report: I've been feeling for months like I've been missing something.
I knew everything, but I needed something else. 
For a while I thought it was knowledge.
Only today did I realize it was experience.
I needed to DO something. 
Something significant.
Well, so one can debate over whether or not what was done today was significant, but nonetheless, it felt nice to do it, so that's good enough for me.
I made a game of pong.
A simple version, out of laziness rather than any artistic purpose.
